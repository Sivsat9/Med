Gen AI-Enabled Personalized Diabetes Risk Management (DRM) Using Patient Health Records

Diabetes is a global health concern, affecting millions of individuals and contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Early identification of individuals at risk for diabetes is critical to enabling timely interventions and personalized care strategies. This study explores the development of a Gen AI-enabled Personalized Diabetes Risk Management (DRM) system, which leverages patient health records to predict diabetes risk and provide customized recommendations. By integrating generative AI with key medical data, including demographic, lifestyle, and biomarker inputs, the system identifies high-risk individuals and suggests evidence-based preventive measures.

The proposed model employs advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze longitudinal health data, generating actionable insights for clinicians and patients. Preliminary results indicate the model’s potential to achieve high accuracy in diabetes risk prediction, surpassing traditional risk-scoring methods. Furthermore, the system facilitates patient engagement through tailored lifestyle and medication recommendations, improving adherence to preventive strategies. This research highlights the transformative role of AI in revolutionizing diabetes care, paving the way for scalable, cost-effective, and patient-centered solutions in healthcare. Future work aims to validate the system’s effectiveness in diverse populations and integrate real-time monitoring for enhanced precision.
